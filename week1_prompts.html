    <h2>1.Describe your previous experience with coding?</h2>
    <h2> a.What classes have you taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?</h2>
    <h2> b. What parts of the class resonated with you?</h2>
    <h2> c. Which parts were the most confusing?</h2>
    <p>The class that I've taken that I have my previous experience with coding is Core 1:Interaction. Before taking Core 1: Interaction, I've never done coding before. So, actually, I had a hard time in the beginning of last semester. The most confusing part is JS. I found it is hard to understanding the rule or instructions of how JS operrates. The most resonated part is it is interesting to using coding to nake animation and effects based on the typography. I want to explore more on how to interact with the website. </p>
    <h2>2.How are you feeling about learning to code in this class? Nervous? Excited?</h2>
    <p>I'm very nurvous since in the last semester, I spent a lot of time doing the coding assignment. </p>
